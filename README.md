## Description:

This project is a Java web application built using JDBC, Servlet, PostgreSQL, and Tomcat. It serves as a practical demonstration of performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a relational database within a web environment. By leveraging these technologies, the application provides a robust framework for managing data stored in a PostgreSQL database.
